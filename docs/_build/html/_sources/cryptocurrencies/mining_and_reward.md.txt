Mining and Reward
=================

**Quadrans reward mechanism** is designed to allow Token Holders, Miner nodes and Masternodes to be rewarded for their service to the network, with an amount of QDC that is proportional to the QDT held, every time new QDC are generated.

The distribution of QDC is regulated by an algorithm every time a block is closed (Epoch). QDC of each Epoch are stored on a Smart Contract, and they are sent to Quadrans Token Holders on a monthly basis.

The distribution of  [**newly minted QDC**](quadrans_coin.html#minting-quadrans-coin) is defined by the Quadrans protocol, according to the activity made by Token Holders (including mining nodes) during the previous month. As mining nodes participate to the consensus mechanism, Masternodes and Miner nodes are rewarded with more QDC compared to non-mining Token Holders.

|*|QDT Q.ty|Kind of work|Reward|
|--|--|--|--|
|Holder|⩾ 1|*to be comunicated*|5%|
|Miner|⩾ 1.000|Active node|40%|
|Masternode|⩾ 100.000|Active node|55%|

QDC intended for reward are sent to wallet addresses registered on an active node to simplify the distribution of the reward.

## Enable your node for mining

Through the **Token Portal**, Quadrans Token owners have the possibility to enable mining on their nodes.

To proceed, after registering following the procedure for the [**Quadrans Airdrop**](quadrans_token.html#the-airdrop), simply select the *Add Miner* or *Add Masternode* items from the Nodes menu of the Token Portal, depending on the number of Tokens in your possession.

Important:

* To be recognised as a **Masternode**, a Token Holder needs to own at least **100.000 Quadrans Tokens (QDT)** and join Quadrans network by installing a node.
* To be recognised as a **Miner**, a Token Holder needs to own at least **1.000 Quadrans Tokens (QDT)** and join Quadrans network by installing a node.
* Check that in your node the mining options are enabled in the [configuration file](../nodes/index.html#installation).

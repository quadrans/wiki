Quadrans Nodes
==============

The Quadrans network is composed by three types of nodes. Masternodes, Miner nodes and Lightnodes.

## Masternodes

Masternodes dispatch incoming transactions to achieve the network consensus and keep up to date the state of the network. The maximum number of Masternodes that Quadrans  network can host is 2.500.

The tasks performed by a Masternode are:
* dispatching incoming transactions;
* authorizing blocks, achieving consensus within Quadrans network.

To be recognised as a Masternode, a Token Holder needs to:
* own enough [Quadrans Tokens](../../cryptocurrencies/quadrans_token) (100.000 QDT);
* join Quadrans network by installing a node.

## Miner nodes

At the moment Miner nodes perform the same function of Masternodes and actively participate to the consensus mechanism. The objective is to support the growth of the network in order to accommodate the improvements to the consensus mechanism described in Quadrans Yellow Paper.

To be recognised as a Miner node, a Token Holder needs to:
* own enough [Quadrans Tokens](../../cryptocurrencies/quadrans_token) (1.000 QDT);
* join Quadrans network by installing a node.

## Lightnodes

Lightnodes are nodes of the network that does not perform mining operations. As Quadrans blockchain is open and public, anyone can run a Lightnode and contribute to the expansion of the network, increasing data decentralization and distribution.
